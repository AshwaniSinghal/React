1. What is CSS selectors ?
  Ans: CSS selectors are used to find the HTMl which needs to be styled.
    Simple Selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
      * {} -> Universal selector
      p {} -> Selector based on HTML element name
      #myId {} -> Selector based on ID
      .myclass {} -> Selector based on classname defined on html element.
      p .myclass {} -> To target only p element with myclass as classname.
      h1, h2, p {} -> Grouping of selector. Now these styles will be applied to all h1, h2 and p elements.
    
    Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
      div p {} -> Desendent selector. This will target all the p tags which are under div.
      div > p -> The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element
      
    Pseudo-Class selector (select elements based on a certain state)
    Pseudo-element selector (select and style a part of an element))
    Attribute selector (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
