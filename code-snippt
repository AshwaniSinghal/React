1. What is the difference between below two code snippt.
Ans: In first case, a different callback is created each time the button renders.n most cases, this is fine. 
However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. 

class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick(event) {
    console.log("This is sample function");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={(event) => this.handleClick(event)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}

class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super(props);
    
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    console.log("This is sample function");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
